I am from the mountains,
Of course I love it,
The air is clean,
Fresh,
The altitude is high,
And food from nature is virtually free,
Berries and nuts are abundant, it is organic,
Not to mention the spring water,
There are no villages,
No towns or next-door neighbors, 
It doesn't cost much to live in the mountains,
You don't really need money to live there,
A city is filled with people who get mad at you for being in the way,
It has people who rob each other,
And people who fight each other,
That's not nice,
In the mountains, you can walk in the open without being bothered by any person,
But in a city, people will approach you on the streets,
You can make all the noise you want in the mountains,
But in the city, people will tell you to go to sleep,
Nature and I are one.
