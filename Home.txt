The place that I grew up in the U.S. doesn't require a license to drive. That's because it's open land, with forests & rocky, unpaved roads. There are about 51 people who live in a 15 kilometer radius. I was raised among the mountain people who live 100 years, give or take some.

The true rural mountain region, where the law is nature. You could blast a dynamite & nobody will care to notice because there is hardly anyone around for tens of miles/kilometers.

Cell service? Yeah good luck with that. Bring a 2-way radio instead. It's fricken awesome. As long as you stay away from the old uranium mines, you'll be in peak health. No pun intended.

Healthy food isn't hard to find. The mountain is lush with nuts, seeds, berries, fresh meat, tea, etc., all natural. Only pick pine nuts every 3 years, you'll be glad that you did.

Chop firewood from old, dead trees. Reduce the fire hazard that comes with the lightning storm. It's definitely not humid here.

Wake up with the birds singing at 4AM. Fetch some cold water from the rock spring. Throw some cedar twigs into the little fire for that nice crackle. Sappy wood burns longer.

Make your own tough leather boots. It's worth it. Tree sap is good for patching up wounds. There's no hospital nearby. Have back-up plans. This is Indigenous homeland :)

This is my home in northern Arizona, 400 miles (644 km) from Phoenix üå§üèî‚õ∞Ô∏è. Elevation: +9,000 ft (+3,000 m).
