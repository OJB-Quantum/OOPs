I am a walking tank, but I am not a machine,
I am an alien, but I am from Earth, living in my own country,
I do not like using the letter "I" excessively, but there are many in this document,
I have 50 years of experience, but I am only in my 20s,
I live in a humid part of the world, but I come from a dry place,
I was born before Wi-Fi, Google, & DVDs, again, I am only in my 20s.
